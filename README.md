Odin - Project: Recipes

This project tests my ability to create and edit in HTML. I started with the main index.html page and built out 3 recipes pages (lasagna, cookies, and ratatouille). Each page contains the recipe heading,  image, description, ingredients, and steps. It definitely doesn't look the prettiest, so I'm excited to start learning CSS.
